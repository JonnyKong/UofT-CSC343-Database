### This is the group project for the course "Introducion to Databases" from the University of Toronto.

## Assignment 1: Relational Algebra
* Read a new relational schema, and determine whether or not a particular instance is valid with respect to that schema.
* Apply the individual techniques for writing relational algebra queries and integrity constraints that we learned in class
* Combine the individual techniques to solve complex problems
* Identify problems that cannot be solved using relational algebra


## Assignment 2: SQL
* Read and interpret a schema 
* Write SQL queries on this schema
* Design datasets to test the schema
* Refer to the postgreSQL documentation
* Embed SQL in Java using JDBC
* Recognize limits to the expressive power of standard SQL


## Assignment 3: Design SQL schema
* Identify tradeoffs that must be made when designing a schema in the relational model, and make reasonable choices
* Express a schema in SQLâ€™s Data Definition Language
* Reason about functional dependencies
* DDL, XML DTD and JSON
* Recognize differences in the strengths of the relational model and the semi-structured model for representing a domain
